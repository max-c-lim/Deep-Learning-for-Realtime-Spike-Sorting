For attr_csv:
3 columns (offset, length, channels)
N rows - First row must be header. Header can be anything but must be something
       - Each following row represents a sample of the recording

offset is relative to sample extracted from recording and âˆˆ [0, length)
length should equal sample_size, both representing length of the sample to extract from recording
channels can be "all" to extract all channels or channel1/channel2/channel3/... (integers separated by "/" for extracting specific channels)
         must be at least 2 channels channel1/channel2 (can be easily fixed by making source code [channels])
         channels refer to channel indices in recording file, so they are channel IDs in spikeinterface and my code
